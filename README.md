## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow
- form with success page

### What I learned

Form validation:

This was the first time I learned form validation. I knew how to do it in react by using the react-hook-form library but wanted to learn to do it in pure js. But quite frankly I could not do it.

Mobile First approach:

In an [article](https://fedmentor.dev/posts/responsive-meaning/) I learned the importance of mobile first approach and how helpful it can be

Responsive website should not be the last thing you do but instead you should start from the mobile version

### Continued development

I would really love to get help on the form validation that I could not learn by following this tutorial because I did not had the time

If anyone would like to help, please fork the repo and make a pull request or hit me on my email: sarimhasanplace123@gmail.com
